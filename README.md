# FakeRoutesGenerator

Fake Routes Generator provides a way to fake localization changes in three predefined paths (which are de facto recorded on real bike trip).  
App has been created for testing HeyRoad app when the weather is too bad for real-life tests and should be not used for cheating in any kind of competitions, games etc.

## Getting started

To start using the app simply install it on the phone and in the Developer options under Debugging set FakeroutesGenerator as a Mock location app.

**Important:**  
To avoid jumping from fake location to real one, make sure to disable [Google Location Accuracy](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/3467281?hl=en).  

## Usage

To get fake locations simply run the app, and press start. The service will start providing fake coordinates immediately.


If fake location doesn't work when a phone is locked - try plugging your phone for charging.
